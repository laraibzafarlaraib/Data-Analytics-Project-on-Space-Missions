# Data-Analytics-Project-on-Space-Missions

This project explores data analytics techniques applied to space mission data. It involves data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization to derive meaningful insights from mission-related datasets. The project aims to highlight trends, patterns, and anomalies in space missions, focusing on areas such as mission success rates, spacecraft performance, and mission timelines.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to:

- Collect data from various space missions.
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends.
- Visualize the results through insightful graphs and charts.
- Derive actionable insights to support future space missions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data analysis and visualization
  - Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive analysis
- **Streamlit**: For interactive app
## Dataset

The dataset includes information about various space missions, such as:

- Mission name
- Launch date
- Spacecraft type
- Mission objectives
- Success/failure outcomes
- Duration of the mission
- Budget allocation (if available)
